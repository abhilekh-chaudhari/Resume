Mumbai, India

•	Analyzed the requirements with business analysts, discussed the design wireframes with UX designers and estimated delivery time for upcoming features to project owners.
•	Developed and tested features of cross-platform based hybrid mobile application for a major US-based telecom company.
•	Coordinated with 10-15 separate teams of 8-10 individuals working in parallel in the Product-Feature Development Team, 
Production Support Team, to understand developed features.
•	Resolved major defects ranging through multiple layers and improved the overall code quality by 20% using SonarQube
parameters and optimized code.
•	Acted within a cross-functional, scrum-based team focused on agile and continuous delivery.
Languages: AngularJS, Java, HTML & CSS.

#PROJECTS
	
Single Image Super Resolution using Convolutional Neural Networks:                                                                        
•	Built software to upgrade images with low resolution to images with high resolution using CNN.
•	Achieved Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) value of 22 on BSD300 dataset using Pytorch library, Python, MATLAB.

Language classifier Using Decision Trees and Adaboost:                                                                                                               •	Built a framework that uses Python machine learning algorithms to decide the language of a sentence to be English or Dutch.
•	Generated 10 features from a dataset of 10000 short sentences for classification of sentences as English or Dutch.
•	Compared accuracy of Decision Tree classifier and Adaboost, achieved highest accuracy of 95% for Adaboost.

Chess Tutor System Using Artificial Intelligence:                                                                                     
•	Developed Chess desktop application for beginner players to play against AI.
•	Added feature allowing players to restart same game after losing, from the worst move made by player on the board. 
•	Implemented algorithms like Min-max Algorithm, Alpha-beta Pruning in Java to generate and filter moves for CPU to make.

Car Rental System:

•	Designed UI using Java Swing and used MongoDB for database.

PUBLICATIONS	

Identification of Human Characteristics through Speech using Machine Learning Approach (IEEE):         
•	Collected 250 original speech samples of different age and gender groups to train different machine learning models such as KNN, SVM, and decision trees.
•	Created Python-based desktop application to predict test speech sample’s age and gender. 
•	Analyzed and developed feature to compare the accuracy of different learning models for same training and test data, achieved highest accuracy of 95% for decision trees.
